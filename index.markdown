\BlueLaTeX aims to provide an tool chain to easily write documents collaboratively.

The first intended audience is the academic world, by integrating concepts and lifecycles particularly well-suited for these kind of documents, but it can be used for any purpose.

\BlueLaTeX is still in beta version and not intended for production yet. Any [feedback](contact/) is welcome to help it making a great application!
