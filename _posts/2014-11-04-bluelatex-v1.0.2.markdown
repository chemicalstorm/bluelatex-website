Hi all,

One month after the first patch version in the 1.0.x branch, we are glad to announce the release of \BlueLaTeX in its version 1.0.2.

This is a maintenance release which fixes some problems in the web client, and improves the user experience.

The exact [changelog](https://github.com/gnieh/bluelatex/blob/v1.0.2/changelog/v1.0.x.markdown#version-102) is exceptionnaly given in its entirety here:

 - Fix a regression in paper option (issue #156)
 - Make 'clone' and 'report issue' links configurable (issue #161)
 - Add an update script (issue #155)

Nothing should break, no configuration is to change, to update from a previous version, follow the instruction [from the documentation](/installation/#upgrade).

You can retrieve the new version in the [download section](/download/). RPM packages should be available soon, stay tuned for this by following us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/bluelatex_team).

Thanks again to the contributors of this version, for your feedback on the previous version and your contributions on this one.

We would be happy to get feedback so that further versions can bring you anything you want in a real-time collaborative editor!
Do not hesitate to [contact us](/community/) if you have questions, problems or ideas.

The \BlueLaTeX Team.
