Hi all,

We are really glad to announce the release of \BlueLaTeX in its version 1.0.0.

This version looks feature complete to us and allows you to:

 - manage user accounts,
 - manage documents and people involved in them:
   - authors who can edit the document,
   - reviewers who can view the compiled document,
 - collaboratively edit your documents in a real-time editor with support for:
   - multi files,
   - multi-cursor to see where other people are editing,
   - SyncTeX to bi-directionally synchronize between your editor and the compiled pdf file,
   - several \LaTeX compilers,
 - download the entire document source files to have local backup,
 - download the compiled pdf file.

\BlueLaTeX can be installed locally so that you can stay the full owner of your data. No connection to any external service is required.
To get it, simply [download](/download/) a binary package, [install](/installation/) it, [configure](/configuration/) it and [run](/running/) it.

Or you can [try it online](https://demo.bluelatex.org) and soon use it on the [publications.li](http://publications.li) hosted service.

For people interested in integrating \BlueLaTeX in their favorite editor and turn it into a \BlueLaTeX client, you can refer to the [API documentation](/api/)

We want to thanks the contributors of this version:

 - Audric for his work on the synchronization protocol,
 - Thomas for the amazing web client he made,
 - Early testers who gave us priceless feedback and made it possible to make this version as good as possible.

We would be happy to get feedback so that further versions can bring you anything you want in a real-time collaborative editor!
Do not hesitate to [contact us](/community/) if you have questions, problems or ideas.

The \BlueLaTeX Team.
