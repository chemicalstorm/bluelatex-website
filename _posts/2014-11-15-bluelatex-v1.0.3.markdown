Hi all,

It's only been 10 days since the last \BlueLaTeX patch release, and yet we are already releasing a new one.

Why the rush? Because of, mainly, a big regression in the web client and, also, some small usability problems.

The exact [changelog](https://github.com/gnieh/bluelatex/blob/v1.0.3/changelog/v1.0.x.markdown#version-103) is given in it entirety one more time:

 - Add button to cleanup compilation directory (issue #173)
 - Reload pdf file when compilation failed but produced a new pdf file (issue #168)
 - Fix regression bug in web client making it impossible to modify user settings (issue #175)

Nothing should break, no configuration is to change, to update from a previous version, follow the instruction [from the documentation](/installation/#upgrade).

You can retrieve the new version in the [download section](/download/). RPM packages should be available soon, stay tuned for this by following us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/bluelatex_team).

Thanks again to the contributors of this version, for your feedback on the previous version and your contributions on this one.

We would be happy to get feedback so that further versions can bring you anything you want in a real-time collaborative editor!
Do not hesitate to [contact us](/community/) if you have questions, problems or ideas.

The \BlueLaTeX Team.
