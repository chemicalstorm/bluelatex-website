It includes:

   - manage user (registration, unregistration, ...),
   - manage \LaTeX papers (creation, deletion, editing, sharing, ...),
   - real-time synchronization between authors,
   - server-side compilation of \LaTeX files;
 - a complete web client giving ability to use all features of \BlueLaTeX,
 - an infrastructure allowing for future developments and improvements.

For the next version the currently planned features include:

 - different kind of documents (with support for markdown),
 - OAuth authentication into the service,
 - VCS integration,
 - more to come...
